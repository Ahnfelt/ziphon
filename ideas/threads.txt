# Access is given on a first-come first-served basis.
# Reads can be performed concurrently.

# Prevents deadlocks since there is only one order in which to obtain locks
# Ensures that you release the locks you take.
# Makes it possible to nest locks, making it possible to reuse code.
# Efficient, since multiple reads can be performed concurrently.
# The focus is on data, not on code.
